# 📄 AI CV Analysis (Gemini + FAISS + RAG)

An intelligent **CV analysis assistant** that helps HR teams and recruiters by:

* Uploading and storing CVs (PDFs or ZIP of PDFs).
* Asking natural language questions about candidates.
* Searching across multiple resumes with semantic similarity.
* Getting concise answers with cited sources.

The system is powered by **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**:

1. **Retrieval:** CVs are split into chunks, embedded with **GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings**, and stored in **FAISS**.
2. **Augmentation:** When a question is asked, the most relevant chunks are retrieved.
3. **Generation:** The context is passed to **Gemini LLM**, which generates a natural language answer with citations.

## 🚀 Features

* Upload CVs (PDF or ZIP).
* Reset and manage the CV vector database.
* Adjustable **Top-K** retrieval and **temperature** for LLM responses.
* Interactive **chat interface** for asking recruitment-related questions.
* Shows answer sources (CV file + page number).
* Live status of the backend system.
